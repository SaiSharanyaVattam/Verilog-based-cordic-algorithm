This project focuses on the implementation of the CORDIC algorithm using Verilog HDL for efficient trigonometric computations in hardware. The CORDIC algorithm, standing for "COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer," is well-suited for hardware implementations due to its iterative nature and ability to compute various transcendental functions like sine, cosine, and arctangent. The design aims to optimize performance and minimize resource utilization by breaking down the algorithm into iterative stages.The CORDIC algorithm is essential for performing trigonometric calculations (e.g., sine, cosine, arctangent) and vector rotations in various digital signal processing (DSP) applications and communication systems. Through pipelining and parallelism, the hardware architecture achieves high-speed vector rotations and accurate trigonometric function generation.
